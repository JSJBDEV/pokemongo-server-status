# Pokemon Go Server Status
Pokemon Go's Server Status checker  

## [Check it out live here](http://poke.tips/server-status/)

Using reddit user [almyz125's](https://github.com/MelonSmasher/pokemon-go-status) Ruby code, I've translated it into Javascript.  
It uses jQuery version 1.12+ as well as [ping.js](https://github.com/jdfreder/pingjs) to check server's responsiveness.  

Basically everything you need is in the serverstatus.html file, though it would be wise to separate the css and js into separate files later on.  

Also it's not pretty because I am using it on my website which includes all of the CSS styling.
