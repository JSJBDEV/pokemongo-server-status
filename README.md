# Pokemon Go Server Status
Pokemon Go's Server Status checker  

## [Check it out live here](http://poke.tips/server-status/)

Using reddit user [almyz125's](https://github.com/MelonSmasher/pokemon-go-status) Ruby code, I've translated it into Javascript.  
It uses jQuery version 1.12+ as well as [ping.js](https://github.com/jdfreder/pingjs) to check server's responsiveness.  

index.html has the text that is needed, style.css is just simple styling, and script.js has the server status script.
